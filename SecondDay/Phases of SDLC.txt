Phases of SDLC

1.Requirements Analysis
The process of collecting, analysing, and documenting user and system requirements. The output is usually a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.

2.System Design
The phase where the overall system architecture and detailed design are prepared based on the requirements. It includes module design, database design, and interface design.

3.Implementation (Coding)
In this phase, developers convert the system design into source code using suitable programming languages and tools.

4.Testing
Testing is performed to verify and validate that the software works correctly and meets the specified requirements. It includes Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

5.Deployment
After successful testing, the application is released into the production environment for real-world usage by end users.

6.Maintenance
This phase involves post-deployment support such as fixing bugs, improving performance, applying updates, and adding new features based on user feedback.
